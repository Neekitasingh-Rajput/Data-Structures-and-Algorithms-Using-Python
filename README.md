# Data-Structures-and-Algorithms-Using-Python
Lab exercises and assignments from Semester 2 : Data Structures and Algorithms course at CHRIST (Deemed to be University).

## Project Description

This repository documents the **lab exercises and assignments**, along with supplementary **Bridge Lab** exercises, completed for the **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** course during **Semester II** at **CHRIST (Deemed to be University)**.

The core labs focus on the implementation of fundamental Data Structures like **Arrays**, **Linked Lists** (Singly, Doubly, and Circular), **Stacks**, and **Queues**, alongside core **Searching and Sorting Algorithms** implemented in Python.

## Lab Index (Data Structures & Algorithms)

The record is organized into sequential Jupyter Notebook files (`.ipynb`), covering the core DSA syllabus topics.

| **`Lab01.ipynb`** | Introduction to OOP & Classes | Implementation of the `Rectangle` class and a **Flashcard** class. |
| **`Lab02.ipynb`** | Python `array` module | Creating arrays, array reversal, sorting, and element counting. |
| **`Lab03.ipynb`** | Sorting Algorithms I | Implementing **Selection Sort** and **Bubble Sort**. |
| **`Lab04.ipynb`** | Sorting Algorithms II | Implementing **Merge Sort** and **Quick Sort**. |
| **`Lab05.ipynb`** | Searching Algorithms | Implementing **Binary Search** and counting element occurrences. |
| **`Lab06.ipynb`** | Singly Linked List | Creating an SLL and implementing various node **removal** operations. |
| **`Lab07.ipynb`** | Doubly Linked List | Implementing a DLL and implementing various node **insertion** operations. |
| **`Lab08.ipynb`** | Circular Linked List | Implementing a CLL and supporting various **insertion** operations. |
| **`Lab09.ipynb`** | Stack | Implementing a **Stack** using an array, and converting **Infix to Postfix** expressions. |
| **`Lab10.ipynb`** | Queue | Implementing a **Queue** using an array, and checking queue equality. |

## Bridge Lab Exercises

This section contains supplementary work (Bridge Labs) that focuses on foundational Python concepts necessary for DSA implementation.

| File | Primary Topic | Key Focus |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **`Bridge Lab 1.ipynb`** | Python Fundamentals & Control Flow | Implementation of **loops** and **conditional logic**, including triangle classification logic. |
| **`Bridge Lab 2.ipynb`** | Python Collections (List/Tuple) | Detailed manipulation and operations on **Lists** and **Tuples** (slicing, methods, searching, conversion, and modification). |
